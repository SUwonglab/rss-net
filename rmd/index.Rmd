Welcome to RSS-NET wiki!

This wiki hosts documentations of RSS-NET software.
If you have any question or suggestion about RSS-NET,
please feel free to create a new
[issue](https://github.com/SUwonglab/rss-net/issues)
and/or send an email to `xiangzhu[at]psu.edu`.

The RSS-NET methodology and its application to 38 gene regulatory networks
and 18 human complex traits are described in the following article:

> Xiang Zhu, Zhana Duren, Wing Hung Wong (2020).
> Modeling regulatory network topology improves genome-wide analyses of complex human traits.
> *bioRxiv*. <https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990010>.

All 38 gene regulatory networks used in this study are freely available at
[`suwonglab/rss-net/data`](https://github.com/SUwonglab/rss-net/tree/master/data).

The full RSS-NET analysis results of 38 networks and 18 traits
are freely available at the [Results Page](results.html).

If you find the analysis results, the pre-processed network files,
the statistical methods, and/or the open-source software useful for your work,
please kindly cite the research article listed above [(Zhu et al, 2020)][].

This page gives the following end-to-end examples of using RSS-NET methods and software.

1. RSS-NET analysis of [two synthetic datasets](wtccc_bcell.html)

2. RSS-NET analysis of [a real-world dataset](ibd2015_nkcell.html)

These examples are based on simulation studies
and data analyses reported in [Zhu et al (2020)][].
