## Overview

Here we describe an end-to-end RSS-NET analysis of
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) GWAS summary statistics
[(Liu et al, 2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26192919)
and a gene regulatory network inferred for natural killer (NK) cells.
This example illustrates the actual data analyses performed in [Zhu et al (2019)][].
