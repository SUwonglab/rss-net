# RSS-NET: Regression with Summary Statistics exploiting NEtwork Topology

The present repository contains source codes and documentations of RSS-NET,
a novel Bayesian framework for simultaneous enrichment and prioritization
analysis of complex trait GWAS and gene regulatory network. 

## Getting started

1. [Install](https://suwonglab.github.io/rss-net/setup.html) the RSS-NET software.

2. Try RSS-NET on [two synthetic datasets](https://suwonglab.github.io/rss-net/wtccc_bcell.html).

3. Try RSS-NET on [a real-world dataset](https://suwonglab.github.io/rss-net/ibd2015_nkcell.html).
